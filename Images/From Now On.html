Jettle got a mate! The other character is called Yorg and he's someone else's character. The owner is called bjork214 on DeviantArt, I wanted to make his character an Argonian while bjork wanted him to be a Dragonborn. Now he's a Dragonborn Argonian Battle Mage! Jettle is herself still. (But she needs a bio so I'll get to work on that sometime)</p>
