Ricochet is the name of Techgirl Unit-80. She was redesigned from an organic human to a male fantasy.<br>
<br>
She was the first Techgirl I made. I've gotten the influence for her design from the same person that doomed my artist career and there after tried to make something more unique. Ricochet is a babe but not lusty. She's actually shy and not like Aeyla who uses her body to mess around with men. Ricochet is an assistant to a rather scared man called Jeff. She always was Jeff's maid but they don't fuck. Even if Jeff wanted to he's too incapable of saying something to her.<br>
<br>
During nights Ricochet would want to go to raves after Jeff is asleep. She enjoy dancing with the others. She's also a very skilled engineer and would build random things around Jeff's home as a way to help him. Sometimes it works. But it'l also fail sometimes.<br>
