I remembered a big breasted l4d witch on an old animation made by another Swedish guy named StickSkulls(Sorry if I butchered the name man). I kinda feel somewhat in-love with this character. An infected but big and sexy lady with hidden eyes. It is something a fetish artist would enjoy since the nature of fetish artists is really questionable and I draw art of a Zombie with enormous breasts. I don't know Hogis in person but I do want to cause he can't be a too bad person. Don't know if he's a fetish artist since his girls gets smaller every time, which is because of criticism, but we're on the same land so he can be someone to understand.<br>
<br>
I don't know what happened to Victoria in the end. But I hope I'm still able to draw her.<br>
