Medea is a nice and polite snake girl. Sometimes a-bit clumsy but knows one or two things about art. She's being a reviewer and will criticize other's art with ease, patience and fairness. She would want to make her own art, but her breasts are too big so she never get any space for work. She would rather be smaller so she would get to work on her book.<br>
<br>
She has a shy attitude and barely any fighting strength. But no matter what problem she has the biggest one is her personality disorder. Every once and awhile her attitude changes to some wild and crazy reptile who is controlled by lust. It doesn't last too long but can give Medea a-lot of problems. Especially when she's "Huge". This personality that gets her into trouble is called Naga.<br>
<br>
She's an adult. But also 6 years old.<br>
