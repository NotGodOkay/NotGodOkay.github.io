Thoughts and news are open! Good Damn this is gonna be painfull..<br>
So do I have something to tell? Well I can't lie about what is going on now cause nothing interesting has happened to me as NotGod. Now I'm just thinking if I should do something less Arruna related but I'm waiting for something to happen. Maybe redo some old art, work on my plans or quit again to easen my patience. Waiting for what? I'm waiting for talk. I am unable to speak so of course my life is shet, always been shet but I'm pushing on anyway cause I got aims.<br>
<br>
<br>
I where however thinking about drawing the Dancer of the Boreal Valley from Dark Souls. Altho I never played Dark Souls but the character was an aim for me to draw so it might be sooner than expected. Or fuckno. I heard the Quake1 soundtrack from the Nintendo 64 version and became a fan of it instantly. Only wish I could get a way to let people send comments on my website cause that could be rather usefull for me who wants to talk with people.<br>
<br>
<br>
Really usefull.<br>

I have returned to DeviantArt and possibly broken some part of me that was unwanted. If it was unwanted, good. If it wasn't, shame on me.<br>
Where to go now? I should continue with the Arruna animation but I decided to take it easy with the reptile that started it all. And think. I never thought that I was such a huge furry before. Maybe the Argonians from TES4 Oblivion was the most beautifull looking creatures while ever other race is damn ugly. That really must be the reason they got popular.<br>
<br>
<br>
And about animation. Maybe I should do something with the Dancer? (Recently got an idea) Well I'm really just a perv and unlikeable to a decent amount of people so I might do that. Sooner.<br>
Great. More plans for the future.<br>

No one's getting rid of me. Apparently I just can't get rid of my fetish. It's haunting me until I'm forced to go back to it.<br>
<br>
So now what? Why did I come back? Currently I've grown an interest in another HogisGuy character named 'Kim'. Obviously cause she's the artist's favorite and many other people's as-well. I also wanted to try out bending 2D shapes in Unity with Anima2D and will possibly implement it for some animations. I made Kim's tits jiggle as a start so maybe something like that will come out.<br>

Okay it was a long time since I've done one of these so this is a comeback. Or maybe it isn't worth putting these out since no one reads them?<br>
<br>
The reason I made this page is to express how I feel and what people should know from me. If no one reads these then what's the point? I'm a help seeker. I can't go to a therapist because I don't think I ever can do that. Sometimes my feelings takes over and just train-wrecks everything and no one holds an eye on me? Can someone at-least try to help without me asking for help like a pathetic little prick?<br>
<br>
It kinda sickens me.<br>

I would really want some way to make a comments section for this site. But on the other hand it wouldn't be really that useful if I'm vanishing sooner or later, all the time.<br>
<br>
So I changed the main page's music to something more (Living?). Everyone enjoys some piece of Quake really.<br>

So now another Argonian is gonna get fetished all over. Now an actual ingame Argonian. Which is Beewos the Sheogorath cultist who thinks she's a dog.<br>
<br>
I failed at leaving again btw. And I'm afraid I might not ever go anywhere else than here. But what can I do?<br>
<br>

That wasn't very long. Was longer before. Oh well.<br>

Gotta be honest really. Maybe no comment section on this site is healthy for me. Because there's douchebags that can spam on it without mercy.<br>
<br>
Oh and apparently not everyone is positive about fanart of their characters. And Angela45. The dragon lady was fine until Xarda took her away and I kinda wanted to make art of her. But I can't if this is going to happen! Or I can and just keep it here for so less to see and not say shit about it.<br>
<br>
This isn't just a website. It is my realm, a happy place. A real happy place.<br>
<br>

Website's been reactivated. Are also planing on making my art here exclusive to the website. Will try my best not to submit to any other site.<br>
<br>
It's gonna haunt my dreams but I think it's too late for me to go back since how many times I've returned. Might as-well say who I am! Later.<br>
<br>
=== === === === === === === === ===<br>

Reactivated my DeviantArt and removed Angela from my website. Not because he wanted it gone but because I'm not risking myself for someone's bad fetish for a character he didn't deserve.<br>
